"Rationale: Increased EC2 cost by moving to larger instances (i.e. to m5dn.2xlarge from t3.2xlarge). Also, increased RDS cost by changing instance size to db.m5.8xlarge from db.m5.4xlarge. Increased load balancer cost by changing dimentions for LCU pricing. Also, increased S3 cost by adding data transfer cost and increasing S3 standard storage capacity.",,,,,,,,
